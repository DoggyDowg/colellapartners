Past clients who have bought, sold, or leased a property through us.

Friends, family, and community members.

Local businesses such as cafes, restaurants, mortgage brokers, and other complementary businesses.

2. Who Can Be Referred?

The referred person (Referee) must:

Be a homeowner looking to sell their residential property, OR

Be a landlord looking to engage Colella Real Estate for property management.

Not already be in contact with Colella Real Estate regarding selling or leasing their property.

Engage in a listing or management agreement with Colella Real Estate within 6 months of the referral.

3. How to Refer?

Referral Partners can refer a seller or landlord through the following methods:

Online Form Submission: Complete the Typeform referral form with the referee’s details.

Direct Connection: Introduce the referee directly to our team via email, phone, or in-person introduction.

Referee Self-Initiation: The referee can contact us directly and mention the referrer’s name at the start of the conversation.

4. Referral Tracking & Confirmation

Upon submission, the referrer will receive a confirmation email acknowledging receipt of the referral.

The Colella Real Estate team will verify if the referral is valid and not already an existing lead.

If valid, the referee will be assigned to a sales agent or property management specialist for follow-up.

The referrer will be updated throughout the process.

5. Reward Payment

The $500 reward is paid only if the referred seller’s property is successfully sold through Colella Real Estate.

The $200 reward per property is paid only if the referred landlord signs a management agreement with Colella Real Estate.

Payment will be processed within 14 days of property settlement (for sales) or lease commencement (for management).

All rewards are issued as gift cards.

In case of multiple referrers for the same seller or landlord, the first valid referral submitted will be considered.
